#### Ensuring All Routes Work: Phased Plan
Given the deployed site is a few commits behind (e.g., add-case form updates), and the user wants both UI and API running on localhost:3000 with MongoDB connected and Firebase set up, a phased plan was developed:

1. **Phase 1: Setup and Sync**:
   - Clone or pull latest commits from GitHub to ensure updates like the add-case form are included.
   - Set up environment variables in `.env` files, with MongoDB URI (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017/adhivakta`) and Firebase config, using user-provided .json or env folder.
   - Install dependencies in both client and server folders using `npm install`.

2. **Phase 2: Run and Test**:
   - Start MongoDB locally to ensure database connectivity.
   - Run the server (`npm run dev` in server folder, likely on port 5000) to handle API requests.
   - Run the client (`npm run dev` in client folder, on port 3000), ensuring proxying to API if needed (e.g., Next.js API routes or separate Express server).
   - Test login with seed users at `/auth/login`, ensuring Firebase Authentication works as set up.

3. **Phase 3: Verify Routes and Functionality**:
   - Test all frontend routes, including `/dashboard`, `/cases/new`, `/cases/:id`, `/cases/:id/chat`, and document-related pages, ensuring they load and function.
   - Verify API routes (e.g., GET `/api/cases`, POST `/api/cases`, PUT `/api/cases/:id`) respond correctly and update MongoDB, using tools like MongoDB Compass to check database changes.
   - Test features like real-time chat (ensure WebSockets or Firebase connectivity) and notifications (email/in-app).
   - Ensure submit actions (e.g., creating a case) send to API endpoints and update the database accordingly.

4. **Phase 4: Fix Issues**:
   - If routes fail, check the server.js file for defined API endpoints and ensure client-side fetch calls match (e.g., `/api/cases`).
   - Ensure CORS is enabled in the server to allow client requests, especially if running on different ports.
   - Debug any errors using browser console and network tab, addressing issues like 404s or 500s.

This plan ensures the user can run both UI and API, see changes on `http://localhost:3000`, and verify all functionality with seed users logging in and updating cases.
